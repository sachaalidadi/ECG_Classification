# ECG_Classification

## Description

This repository contains a python notebook with models trained to solve a classification problem.

The problem is the following:

Classify ECGs in 5 labels

For more informations about my methods, I left detailled comments in the notebook.

If you want to replicate the results you will need the ECGs data on your own Google drive.

You can have the data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-pKOgUvC23KSuvO5uZp-lPwra9nXVVyn?usp=drive_link)
